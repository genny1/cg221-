<h4>Alice Dalton Brown is an American realistic painter that now resides in NY. I choose her website because of her artwork and how well presented the site is. As an artist I also have a passion for realismmoreover I tend to be a perfectionist. I also pock this  website because it shows neatly and well detailed all her artwork that makes you admire her work more easily.</h4>

Pixar is a computer animation film know for creating many great movies. I picked this site not just because I love their work but for the way is design. The site is simple but at the same time intriguing because of its opaque background colors and well pictures.
