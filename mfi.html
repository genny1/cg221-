<h4>Activision is a videogame industry with an amazing website that shows their work. From the graphics, font, sound effects and grid organization,  makes it interesting as well easy to navigate. I love this website because as animator trying to pursue as a game artist designer it keeps me up to date with the techniques being use in the game industries.

The History Of Animation is a site that I found many years ago when I started to study Art and I wanted to get familiar with the field. I search for many sites and when I came across  this one I fell in love with the design , fonts and the characters designs. Also  how the slides match and nicely go from one to another, moreover the way that the site shows how animation with the work of many animators has developed over the years.
