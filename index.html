    <h5>You don’t have to be a cartoonist to have animation be a big part of your life. Animation
is everywhere—in our homes, schools, work,
and everywhere there’s a screen. And if you grew up in
the United States, chances are you’ve witnessed seminal accomplishments in animation history without even
knowing it. Does Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ring
a bell? What about Toy Story…or The Flintstones? These
works marked important milestones in animation, an
art form that continuously challenges its creators to
push technology so that anything that can be imagined
can also be brought to life.</h5>
